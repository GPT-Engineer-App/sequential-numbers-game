# sequential-numbers-game

A game that flashes numbers 1-9 in random order, requiring the user to click on them in sequential order. The game's interface should display each number prominently in the center of the screen, one at a time, and then provide a series of numbered buttons or interactive elements for the user to click in the correct order. The visual style should be engaging yet simple, with bold, readable fonts and a color scheme that's easy on the eyes yet attention-grabbing. After each successful sequence, the game could increase in speed or complexity to maintain interest and challenge.
